# LEGO Sets and Popularity Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of LEGO sets and their popularity. The data is sourced from the website [Most Wiedzy](https://mostwiedzy.pl/en/open-research-data/data-on-lego-sets-release-dates-and-retail-prices-combined-with-aftermarket-transaction-prices-betwe,10210741381038465-0). However, due to data inconsistencies, I have modified the file multiple times (details can be found in the `main` file). I cleaned the data and then, by crawling available LEGO websites, supplemented it with newer information. The resulting data was then visualized.

### Files

- **new_data.xlsx** - contains the cleaned and updated data.
- **main.py** - the script that creates the dataset and modifies the values based on current availability.
- **visualization.py** - the script that generates visualizations based on the created dataset.

### Running the Program

1. **Creating and Modifying the Data**:
   - To run the program, simply execute the `main.py` script, which will create the dataset and adjust the values according to current availability.

2. **Generating Visualizations**:
   - After creating the dataset, you can run the `visualization.py` script to generate visualizations based on the created data.

### Documentation

- Detailed information about the analysis and visualizations is provided in the `report.pdf` document, which is currently only available in Slovak.
